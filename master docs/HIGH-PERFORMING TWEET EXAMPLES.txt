these brain-rot style videos are pulling 10M+ views consistently on TikTok and YouTube Shorts


faceless channels are banking $15K-$50K monthly from this exact format


here's what my n8n workflow does automatically:


- generates viral Peter Griffin & Stewie conversations

- overlays them on Minecraft parkour gameplay
- adds perfectly timed subtitles
- renders complete videos ready to upload


these videos exploit dopamine triggers


the background gameplay keeps viewers glued while the AI-generated dialogue delivers the actual content


it's psychological manipulation at its finest


I spent 40+ hours perfecting this:


- gathering rare audio samples for voice cloning
- training custom AI voice models for both characters
- building the complete automation workflow
- testing render quality and timing


the results speak for themselves


channels using this format are going from 0 to 100K followers in weeks


some are hitting 50M+ monthly views with zero effort after setup


the workflow handles everything:


-content ideation
-script generation
-voice synthesis
- video composition
- final rendering


you literally press one button and get viral-ready content


while everyone's still manually editing videos, smart creators are scaling with automation like this

Insane: 90-95% of Claude Code is now written by Claude Code.


I asked @mikeyk (Anthropic's CPO) what changes when so much of your code is written by AI?  


His answer: The bottleneck moves from coding/design to:
1. Upstream: aligning the team around what to build.
2. Downstream: the PR merge queue, reviewing and merging all of the new code into production. 


Anthropic is where other product teams will be in a year or two, so it's important we pay attention.


"I would expect that a year from now, the way that we are conceiving of building and shipping software changes a lot. Because it's gonna be very painful to do it the current way."
