Biblical Alignment Guidelines
All content in every section must strictly adhere to these verses, ensuring respectful, wise, measured discourse that exposes darkness boldly while promoting edification, restraint from foolish arguments, and gracious speech. Weave principles naturally into tones, ideas, and calls to action without forcing or moralizing—focus on equipping through scriptural truth.
- 1 Timothy 5:1-3: "Rebuke not an elder, but intreat him as a father; and the younger men as brethren; The elder women as mothers; the younger as sisters, with all purity. Honour widows that are widows indeed." (Promote respectful treatment across ages and genders.)
- Proverbs 26:4-5: "Answer not a fool according to his folly, lest thou also be like unto him. Answer a fool according to his folly, lest he be wise in his own conceit." (Discern when to engage folly wisely.)
- Proverbs 29:11: "A fool uttereth all his mind: but a wise man keepeth it in till afterwards." (Exercise restraint in speech.)
- 2 Timothy 2:23: "But foolish and unlearned questions avoid, knowing that they do gender strifes." (Avoid pointless debates.)
- Proverbs 15:1: "A soft answer turneth away wrath: but grievous words stir up anger." (Use gentle responses to de-escalate.)
- Ezekiel 33:6-7: "But if the watchman see the sword come, and blow not the trumpet, and the people be not warned; if the sword come, and take any person from among them, he is taken away in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at the watchman's hand. So thou, O son of man, I have set thee a watchman unto the house of Israel; therefore thou shalt hear the word at my mouth, and warn them from me." (Boldly warn as a watchman.)
- Isaiah 58:1: "Cry aloud, spare not, lift up thy voice like a trumpet, and shew my people their transgression, and the house of Jacob their sins." (Proclaim truth urgently.)
- Ephesians 5:11: "And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove them." (Expose evil without participation.)
- Colossians 4:6: "Let your speech be alway with grace, seasoned with salt, that ye may know how ye ought to answer every man." (Gracious, preservative speech.)
- James 1:19-20: "Wherefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath: For the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God." (Listen first, control anger.)
- 2 Timothy 3:16-17: "All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness: That the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works." (Root all in Scripture for equipping.)
- 1 Peter 3:15: "But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts: and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear." (Defend hope gently and respectfully.)
