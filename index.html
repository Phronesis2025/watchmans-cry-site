            Patriots, behold the hour! As 2026 unfolds, the republic quakes
            under the weight of lawlessness unleashed. Tens of thousands flood
            Minneapolis streets in raging protests over a fatal ICE shooting of
            activist Renee Good—chanting "Abolish ICE," hurling ice and rocks,
            blocking roads in defiance of order. Nationwide, over 1,000 rallies
            erupt against deportations, from Portland to Columbus, with violence
            flaring: protesters clashing with officers, vehicles ramming
            threats, death threats skyrocketing. DHS reports assaults on ICE
            agents up 1,300%, vehicular attacks 3,200%, death threats 8,000%—a
            direct fruit of radical rhetoric from sanctuary politicians and
            cultural scorn for God's appointed sword-bearers. This is no mere
            unrest; it's rebellion against divine order. "He beareth not the
            sword in vain" (Romans 13:4). The wicked mock authority, glorify
            chaos, and invite judgment, while the complacent slumber. Yet hope
            stirs: citizen truth-tellers rise on new frontiers, dismantling
            legacy media's lies; grit of the founders endures at our 250th
            milestone. We anger the wicked by naming their rebellion, awaken the
            sleeping with prophetic thunder, equip the faithful with
            self-reliance, and point to Christ—the Prince of Peace who submits
            yet triumphs over lawlessness. Strip to roots: limited government,
            rule of law, biblical morality—all under assault. Borders mocked,
            heritage eroded, families threatened by imported disorder. But God
            stirs revival amid shadows. Rise, watchmen! The cry goes forth:
            restore order, reclaim sovereignty, or face the furnace of
            consequences. Common sense reborn demands vigilance now.

            We begin our journey not as mere observers, but as active
            participants in the great discourse of our age. The watchman's cry
            echoes across the ages, calling us to remember the principles that
            have guided free peoples throughout history.

            Brother, sister—pull up a chair. It's 2026, and this nation of ours
            is turning 250 years old. Think on that. In 1776, ordinary
            folks—blacksmiths, farmers, millers, men and women with dirt under
            their nails—stood up and said enough to tyranny. They risked
            everything on a simple truth: that liberty comes from God, not
            governments, and that the common man, through hard work and
            perseverance, can govern himself. No other country started like
            that. No crowns, no conquerors—just people who believed a free man
            with a plow or a rifle could build something lasting.
          </p>

          <p>
            Whistleblowers spotted empty shacks claiming 120 kids but showing
            zero; one "center" raked in $1.9 million from a windowless dump.
            Defendants – overwhelmingly Somali – faked enrollments, staged fake
            break-ins to hide tracks, and reopened scams under new names. State
            auditors flagged this as early as 2014, but Democrat enablers like
            Governor Walz buried warnings, terrified of "Islamophobia"
            accusations while courting bloc votes.
          </p>

          <p>
            We've proven it time and again. From scratching out homesteads on
            raw frontier to forging steel that won wars and built skyscrapers
            that scrape the heavens. We fed the world from our fields, lit the
            dark with our inventions, and sent rockets to the moon on the sweat
            of shift workers and engineers who clocked in every dawn. It wasn't
            handouts or shortcuts—it was callused hands, long hours, and the
            stubborn refusal to quit. That's the American character:
            perseverance when the crop fails, the factory closes, or the bills
            stack high. We answer to our families, our communities, and our God,
            not to distant bureaucrats.
          </p>

          <p>
            Sure, we've got our divisions—red states, blue states, loud
            arguments across kitchen tables. But strip it all away, and you'll
            find the same abundance underneath: that rock-solid work ethic
            running through every American vein. The welder in Ohio and the
            rancher in Texas, the nurse in California and the trucker in
            Pennsylvania—they all know sunrise means roll out of bed, provide
            for your own, and leave the place better for your kids. That's not
            politics; that's who we are.
          </p>

          <p>
            And that's why my heart stirs with real hope as we hit this
            milestone. Caution, yes—we've got debts to pay down, borders to
            secure, and moral drift to correct. But the possibilities? Endless,
            if we lean on what got us here. Hard work and perseverance built
            this republic, and they'll rebuild it stronger. Imagine our children
            inheriting factories humming again, communities tight-knit and
            self-reliant, opportunities flowing from honest labor—not government
            schemes, but American grit turned loose.
          </p>

          <p>
            So here's the quiet rally cry, from one working man to another: Roll
            up your sleeves once more. Teach your boys and girls that nothing
            worthwhile comes easy, but anything is possible with faith and
            sweat. Build that business, fix that neighborhood, stand for what's
            right. For their sake—for the grandkids who'll run these fields and
            factories—let's pass on an America even greater than the one handed
            to us.
          </p>

          <p>
            Point to Christ, who worked with His hands and never quit the
            mission. Common sense reborn: our best days aren't behind us.
            They're waiting on the other side of tomorrow's hard work. Let's go
            get 'em.

            In these opening days of 2026, gaze upon the deepening shadows over
            the land. A spirit of lawlessness rises like a flood, manifesting in
            brazen contempt for those divinely appointed to wield the sword of
            justice—our law enforcement officers, the sentinels of order and
            peace. Official reports confirm the grim reality: assaults on U.S.
            Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers have surged more
            than 1,300%, with vehicular attacks skyrocketing over 3,200% and
            death threats escalating a staggering 8,000%. Ambush-style
            premeditated assaults on law enforcement reached 67 in 2025 alone,
            wounding scores and claiming lives through calculated malice. A
            Florida deputy, ambushed and shot point-blank in the face, has only
            recently been released from the hospital—a miracle amid the mounting
            toll. Radical rhetoric from sanctuary strongholds and cultural scorn
            embolden the lawless, turning routine duties into deadly traps.

            We examine how the principles of liberty, justice, and common sense
            have been tested throughout history, and what we might learn from
            those who came before us.

        <!-- Common Man's Counsel -->
        <article class="section">
          <h3>Common Man's Counsel</h3>
          <p class="drop-cap">
            These are not isolated tragedies; they echo ancient warnings etched
            in Holy Writ. Romans 13:3-4 proclaims: "For rulers are not a terror
            to good works, but to evil... He is God's minister to you for good.
            But if you evil, be afraid; for he does not bear the sword in vain."
            To revile and assault the protector is to rebel against God's
            ordinance, unleashing chaos upon society. Recall the days of the
            Judges, when "there was no king in Israel; every man did that which
            was right in his own eyes" (Judges 21:25)—a time of anarchy,
            oppression, and vulnerability to foes. So now: when authority is
            mocked, justice hampered, and protectors ambushed, we mirror that
            descent, forsaking the fear of the Lord wherein true safety lies
            (Proverbs 14:26).
          </p>
          <p>
            Deeper still run the prophetic parallels. As in Isaiah's lament over
            a rebellious people who "call evil good and good evil" (Isaiah
            5:20), we pervert order by demonizing guardians while excusing
            disorder. Israel scorned the watchmen God raised until judgment
            came—armies at the gates, captivity, desolation (Hosea 4:6-7).
            Persist in this scorn, and what awaits? Intensified turmoil: streets
            surrendered to violence, communities fractured, a nation exposed to
            internal rot and external threats. The Lord removes His protection
            when obedience fades, permitting the fruits of rebellion to chasten
            us.
          </p>
          <p>
            Yet, glory to God—mercy endures! The call rings clear: "If My people
            who are called by my name will humble themselves, and pray and seek
            My face, and turn from their wicked ways; then I will hear from
            heaven, and forgive their sin, and heal their land" (2 Chronicles
            7:14). For the obedient and faithful, blessings overflow: divine
            safeguard over homes and streets, strength for families rooted in
            righteousness, restoration of order under godly authority
            (Deuteronomy 28:1-14). Honor the sword-bearers as God's ministers;
            pray fervently for their protection; uphold justice without
            partiality.
          </p>
          <p>
            Point to Christ, the Prince of Peace who submitted to authority yet
            triumphed over lawlessness. Repentance revives; faithfulness invites
            heaven's favor. Heed now, lest the shadows engulf us entirely.
