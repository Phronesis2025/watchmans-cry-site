# Research Dossier: Benjamin Franklin – The Man, The Myth, The Bones in the Basement

## 1. Executive Summary

**Subject:** Benjamin Franklin (1706–1790)
**Focus:** Youth, Culture, Finances, Homelife, and "Unheard" Events.
**Target Audience:** Conservative, Christian X.com (Twitter) users.

Benjamin Franklin is often caricatured as the jovial old man with the kite. The reality is far more complex and compelling. He was the prototype of the American self-made man—industrious, wealthy, and deeply pragmatic. For your specific audience, Franklin represents a bridge between Enlightenment rationality and recognition of Divine Providence. He was also a man of deep contradictions: a champion of liberty who owned slaves (before abolitionism), a moralist with an illegitimate son, and a diplomat who may have literally had skeletons in his closet.

## 2. Deep Dive: Key Subtopics & "Unheard" Events

### Subtopic A: Faith & Providence – The Constitutional Convention Prayer

**The Event:** On June 28, 1787, the Constitutional Convention was deadlocked. Tempers were flaring between small and large states. The entire project of the United States was at risk of collapsing before it began.
**The "Unheard" Detail:** The 81-year-old Franklin, often considered a Deist, made a motion that shocked the room. He called for daily prayer, appealing directly to God’s intervention.

* **Key Quote (Primary Source):**
> "I have lived, Sir, a long time, and the longer I live, the more convincing proofs I see of this truth—that **God governs in the affairs of men.** And if a sparrow cannot fall to the ground without his notice, is it probable that an empire can rise without his aid?"


* **The Outcome:** Surprisingly, the motion did *not* pass. It was adjourned (effectively tabled) because the convention had no funds to pay a chaplain and some feared it would signal desperation to the public.
* **Audience Angle:** This shatters the "godless secular founding" narrative. Franklin, the scientist, acknowledged that human wisdom was insufficient without Divine aid.

### Subtopic B: The Skeleton in the Closet (Literally)

**The Event:** In 1998, conservationists renovating Franklin’s former home at 36 Craven Street in London discovered a pit of bones in the basement.
**The Facts:** Over 1,200 bone fragments from at least 15 bodies (including children) were found.

* **Consensus:** Franklin was not a serial killer. He lived with his friend William Hewson, an anatomist. In the 18th century, sourcing cadavers was illegal and difficult. Hewson ran an anatomy school and buried the medical waste in the basement.
* **The Intrigue:** Franklin almost certainly knew. He was a man of science who likely turned a blind eye to the illegal "resurrection men" (grave robbers) delivering bodies to his backdoor.
* **X.com Hook:** "Did Ben Franklin have a murder dungeon? No, but he did have a secret illegal anatomy lab in his basement."

### Subtopic C: The Family Civil War – Patriot Father vs. Loyalist Son

**The Event:** The American Revolution wasn't just political for Franklin; it was a personal tragedy.
**The Players:**

* **Benjamin Franklin:** Patriot.
* **William Franklin:** Benjamin’s illegitimate son, whom Ben raised and used his influence to get appointed Royal Governor of New Jersey.
**The Conflict:** When the war started, William refused to break his oath to the King. He became a leader of the Loyalists (the "Board of Associated Loyalists"), authorizing guerrilla raids against Patriots—technically fighting his own father’s cause.
**The Aftermath:** William was arrested and eventually exiled to London. After the war, they met once. Benjamin never forgave him, effectively disinheriting him in his will with a stinging line about William trying to "deprive" him of his estate through the war.

### Subtopic D: Weird Science – The Electric Turkey

**The Event:** December 1750. Franklin was convinced that electrocuting a turkey would make the meat unusually tender.
**The Accident:** While demonstrating this to guests, Franklin accidentally touched the conductors. He absorbed a massive charge meant for the bird.

* **Primary Source Account:** He described a "flash" and a "crack of a pistol," followed by numbness. He wrote, *"I am ashamed to have been guilty of so notorious a blunder."*
* **Weird Factor:** The Founding Father nearly killed himself two years *before* the famous kite experiment (1752) trying to cook a turkey.

## 3. Financial & Cultural Analysis

### Finances: The First Franchiser

Most people know Franklin was a printer. Fewer know he was the Ray Kroc of the 18th century.

* **The Model:** Franklin set up printing partnerships in other colonies (Charleston, NYC, Caribbean). He provided the capital and equipment; the partner provided the labor. They split the profits 50/50.
* **The Result:** This passive income allowed him to retire at age 42—unheard of in that era—to devote his life to science and politics.
* **Wealth Hack:** He printed the currency for Pennsylvania and other colonies, literally making money by making money.

### Homelife: The Common-Law Marriage

* **Deborah Read:** Franklin’s wife was a sturdy, industrious woman who ran his business while he was away for years in London and Paris.
* **The Scandal:** They could not legally marry because Deborah’s previous husband had abandoned her but was not confirmed dead (bigamy laws). They lived in a "common-law" marriage, which was socially risky but accepted due to Franklin’s prominence.
* **Tragedy:** Deborah died while Franklin was in London. He did not return for her funeral, a source of guilt and criticism.

## 5. Chronological Timeline of "Unheard" Events

* **1750:** Franklin nearly kills himself electrocuting a turkey.
* **1752:** Flies the kite (famous), but also publishes a chart on the Gulf Stream (unheard scientific contribution).
* **1757-1775:** Lives in London (Craven Street). The "bones" accumulate in the basement during this time.
* **1773:** **The Hutchinson Letters Leaked.** Franklin leaks private letters from the MA Governor to the Crown. He is hauled before the Privy Council in London and humiliated for an hour by the Solicitor General. **This is the moment he silently decides on Independence.**
* **1776:** William Franklin arrested by Patriots; Benjamin refuses to intervene.
* **1787:** Constitutional Convention. Franklin makes the "Sparrow" speech calling for prayer.
* **1790:** Dies. His will leaves William almost nothing.

## 6. Critical Analysis

### Gaps & Uncertainties

* **The Leak:** We still do not know for sure who gave the Hutchinson Letters to Franklin. It remains one of the greatest mysteries of the Revolution.
* **The Spy:** During his time in Paris (1776–1785), Franklin’s secretary, Edward Bancroft, was a British double agent. Did Franklin know? Some historians argue Franklin was too smart to be duped and used Bancroft to feed disinformation to the British. Others think Franklin was old and compromised.

### Quality of Evidence

* **Prayer Motion:** High confidence. Recorded in Madison’s notes.
* **Bones:** High confidence. Physical forensic evidence exists at 36 Craven Street.
* **Turkey:** High confidence. Franklin’s own letters confirm it.

## 7. Actionable Content: X.com Thread Drafts

Here are three distinct angles for your threads based on this research.

### Thread A: The Faith Angle (High Engagement)

**Hook:** They told you the Founding Fathers were godless Deists. They lied. Here is the moment Ben Franklin saved the Constitution with a call to prayer. 🧵👇

1. 1787. The Convention is failing. Arguments are heated.


2. Franklin stands up. The oldest man in the room.
3. Quote: "If a sparrow cannot fall... is it probable that an empire can rise without his aid?"
4. He realized that human ego was the enemy. Only submission to "Divine Providence" could bridge the divide.
5. Franklin wasn't a perfect Christian, but he knew a nation without God could not stand.

### Thread B: The "Weird History" Angle (Viral Potential)

**Hook:** 1,200 human bones were found in Ben Franklin's basement. Was the Founding Father a serial killer? The truth is actually stranger. 🧵💀
**Body Points:**

1. 1998 renovation of his London home uncovers a pit of bones.
2. Forensics show cut marks. Trepanning (drilling into skulls).
3. Enter William Hewson, Franklin's roommate and anatomy pioneer.
4. Grave robbing was the only way to get bodies for science. Franklin likely watched it happen.
5. Science required dirty work. The path to modern medicine is paved through Franklin’s basement.

### Thread C: The Entrepreneur Angle (Conservative/Financial)

**Hook:** Ben Franklin retired at 42. In the 1700s. How? He didn't just work hard; he invented the "Franchise Model" 200 years before McDonald's. 🧵💰
**Body Points:**

1. Franklin was a printer, but he couldn't be everywhere.
2. He set up "partnerships" (franchises) in key cities.
3. He provided the capital/press; they did the work. 50/50 split.
4. Passive income allowed him to become a diplomat and revolutionary.
