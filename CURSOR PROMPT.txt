Current date is January 15, 2026. We are preparing to publish the new edition for Thursday, January 16, 2026.

Follow these exact steps in order. Do not skip or combine steps. Confirm each action before moving to the next.

1. In the project root, locate the current live index.html file.

2. Create a new folder in the project root called "archive" if it does not already exist.

3. Inside the "archive" folder, create a new subfolder named with today's date in YYYY-MM-DD format, i.e., "2026-01-15".

4. Copy the current live index.html file into the archive/2026-01-15/ folder and rename it to index-2026-01-15.html (so we preserve the previous edition exactly).

5. Make a temporary backup of the current live index.html in the project root:
   - Copy index.html to a file named index-backup-before-2026-01-16.html in the root.

6. Now, replace the entire content of the live index.html file with the new code I have in my clipboard (the complete, updated index.html for the January 16, 2026 edition that was just generated).

7. After replacement, do NOT make any other changes to the file — preserve all links, images, classes, dividers, footer, and structure exactly as provided in the new code.

8. Save the file.

9. After completing all steps, reply with a short confirmation list of what you did (e.g., "Archived old edition → Created backup → Replaced live index.html with new edition").

Do not ask for confirmation before proceeding — execute the steps sequentially and safely.
