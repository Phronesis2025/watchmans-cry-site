          <p class="drop-cap">
            In these times of great uncertainty, when the voices of reason are
            drowned by the clamor of division, we take up the mantle of the
            watchman. As the sentinel stands guard through the night, so too
            must we remain vigilant in our pursuit of truth and common sense.
            This publication serves as a beacon for those who seek clarity
            amidst confusion, wisdom in place of folly, and unity over discord.

          <p>
            We begin our journey not as mere observers, but as active
            participants in the great discourse of our age. The watchman's cry
            echoes across the ages, calling us to remember the principles that
            have guided free peoples throughout history.

            The Plain Truth: Minnesota's Somali Daycare Heist – Billions Stolen,
            Borders Mocked, Heritage Erased
          </h3>
          <p class="author-byline">By The Watchman</p>

          <img
            class="woodcut float-right"

          />

          <p class="drop-cap">
            America, wake up and rage! In Minnesota, a massive Somali-led
            daycare fraud ring has looted taxpayers for billions – ghost centers
            with no kids, billing millions for phantom meals and care. The
            Feeding Our Future scam alone stole $250 million in COVID aid, part
            of a web potentially topping $9-10 billion across welfare, Medicaid,
            and housing.
          </p>

          <p>
            Whistleblowers spotted empty shacks claiming 120 kids but showing
            zero; one "center" raked in $1.9 million from a windowless dump.
            Defendants – overwhelmingly Somali – faked enrollments, staged fake
            break-ins to hide tracks, and reopened scams under new names. State
            auditors flagged this as early as 2014, but Democrat enablers like
            Governor Walz buried warnings, terrified of "Islamophobia"
            accusations while courting bloc votes.
          </p>

          <p>
            Where did the money go? Not to hungry American kids. Fraudsters
            splurged on Porsche fleets, waterfront mansions, jewelry, island
            honeymoons – and wired millions overseas. Properties bought in
            Kenya, Turkey, and Somalia itself.
          </p>

          <p>
            Conservative probes and federal sources allege some cash funneled to
            al-Shabaab terror networks taxing Somali regions – remittances
            swelling while our veterans starve. Treasury's investigating, but
            mainstream outlets downplay, claiming "no solid link." Baloney! This
            is organized theft, draining sound money principles to fund foreign
            chaos.
          </p>

          <p>
            And the insults pile on: amid this invasion-by-fraud, Minnesota
            swapped its historic flag for a blue-and-star design mocked
            nationwide as aping Somalia's – or its regional banners. Critics
            howl it's a surrender symbol, scrubbing American heritage for
            globalist virtue-signaling under Walz's watch. Meanwhile, certain
            radical Somali-born politicians in Congress – representing the
            epicenter – saw personal wealth rocket to $30 million ranges via
            obscure disclosures and husband's ventures, all while "defending"
            the community as fraud exploded. Coincidence? Or enablers profiting
            from the rot?
          </p>

          <p>
            This is tyranny: open borders gaming welfare magnets, eroding
            sovereignty, mocking self-reliance. God condemns unjust scales
            (Proverbs 11:1); nations ignoring justice court ruin. America First
            demands: deport exploiters, claw back every dime, prosecute enablers
            high and low. Seal borders, shrink the beast, restore heritage
            before radicals turn the heartland into a third-world outpost.
          </p>

          <p>
            Awaken! Demand raids, freezes, justice. Point to Christ,
            table-flipper of corruption. The cry thunders: reclaim the republic
            now!

            History, as the great teacher, offers us lessons from ages past. In
            this column, we draw parallels between the challenges of our time
            and those faced by previous generations. The patterns of human
            nature remain constant, and by studying the past, we may better
            navigate the present.

            We examine how the principles of liberty, justice, and common sense
