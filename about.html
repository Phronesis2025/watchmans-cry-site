          <h3>Our Mission</h3>
          <p class="drop-cap">
            This is no polite newsletter. The Watchman's Cry: Common Sense
            Reborn is a weekly digital broadsheet that revives the bold,
            unsparing spirit of colonial pamphlets to confront today's tyranny,
            cultural decay, and spiritual drift. We aim to anger the wicked,
            awaken the complacent, equip the faithful, and point every reader
            toward Christ and decisive action. Anonymous. Unapologetic. Grounded
            in biblical truth. America First.

          <h3>Core Principles</h3>

          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>Faith in the Living God:</strong> God is real. The Bible
              is true. Jesus is returning. All wisdom begins here.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>America First:</strong> Our nation's interests, borders,
              and people come before any global scheme or foreign interest.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>First-Principles Thinking:</strong> Strip every issue to
              its roots. Reason upward from fundamentals, not downward from
              narratives.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Traditional Values & Free Enterprise:</strong> We stand
              against woke ideology. We uphold conservative principles and
              defend real capitalism.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Unalienable Rights:</strong> Speech, life, liberty — these
              are God-given, not government-granted.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Personal Responsibility & Self-Reliance:</strong> Stand on
              your own feet. Provide for your family. Answer to God alone.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Family & Biblical Morality:</strong> Strong families are
              the bedrock of any nation.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Limited Government & Sound Money:</strong> Government must
              be small, restrained, and fiscally prudent.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Original Constitutionalism & Rule of Law:</strong> Honor
              the Constitution as the founders intended.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>National Sovereignty Over Globalism:</strong> America's
              destiny belongs to Americans — not international elites.
            </li>

          <h3>Our Approach & Voice</h3>
          <p class="drop-cap">
            Picture this: the sharp ink of 18th-century pamphlets meets the
            lightning-fast mind of 2026. Benjamin Franklin's practical genius —
            tamer of lightning and defender of liberty — fused with Elon Musk's
            first-principles blade, cutting through empires of illusion. Thomas
            Paine's revolutionary fire joined to Donald Trump's unrelenting
            thunder, roaring against debt, open borders, and fraud. J.D. Vance's
            working-class grit mixed with Jefferson's defense of the common man,
            all sharpened by Joe Rogan's raw search for truth.
          </p>

          <p>
            These are not fantasies. They are the beating heart of The
            Watchman's Cry. A modern resurrection of Poor Richard's Almanac,
            forged anonymously in the American heartland. Week after week, we
            cut through the fog: treasuries looted, borders undefended, souls
            starved in a wasteland of lies. No apologies. No retreat. No quarter
            for the corrupt.
          </p>

          <p>
            We speak plainly to the working man in a rigged world, to the
            builder who sees patterns others miss, to the faithful who know the
            storm is near. Unflinching truth. Ancient biblical thunder. An
            urgent call: wake up — before the night falls forever.
          </p>

          <p>The cry is sounding. Will you answer?</p>
