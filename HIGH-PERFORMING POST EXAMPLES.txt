| The moral foundation, legal framework, and civic traditions of THIS country are rooted in the Bible and the Constitution it helped shape. When you take an oath of office, you are not making a personal spiritual statement. You are swearing TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE that you will honor, defend, and uphold OUR laws and OUR system of government. An oath that rejects that foundation is not symbolic—it is meaningless. If the oath does not clearly affirm allegiance to the Constitution and the nation it governs, then it is invalid in spirit and should be void in law. Public office is a trust, not a stage for ideological defiance. Undermine the oath, and you undermine the Republic itself. If this is accepted, it will not stop here. This will only get worse. | 129192 | Emphatic "THIS country" with Bible/Constitution reference. | Logical build: foundation + explanation + warning; paragraph breaks for readability. | Sparks patriotic agreement and shares; invites replies on oaths. | Moral and Religious Foundations; Justice, Law, and Equality. | Urgent, principled, connective. | Reject invalid oaths. | None. | Bible, Constitution, Republic. |
| The states created the federal government, not the other way around. We have the constitutional authority to propose and, ultimately, ratify, needed amendments like term limits for Congress and a federal balanced budget requirement. Glad to meet with legislators in Idaho to discuss the need to rein in the nation’s debt through a balanced budget amendment. 28 states have certified the amendment, and we only need a handful more. | 153149 | Declarative power reversal. | Principle + action + status update; concise policy focus. | Inspires reform hope; state involvement replies. | Limited Government and Federalism; Economic Freedom. | Authoritative, proactive. | Ratify amendments. | None. | Constitution, federalism. |
| Our Founding Fathers built this Republic on Judeo-Christian principles, knowing that only a moral and godly people could keep it. As Americans, we should be fearless about our values. That said, our foundation is under direct attack by a godless enemy. This battle is not only political but spiritual. It is good versus evil. The Republic survives only when citizens rise in their towns, churches, and communities. LOCAL ACTION EQUALS NATIONAL IMPACT. The Founders never intended for Washington to dictate our destiny; they entrusted it to We the People. So I leave you with the question that matters most: How are YOU serving today! | 365400 | Founders and "good versus evil" drama. | History + threat + solution + question; caps emphasis. | Spiritual fervor shares. | Moral Foundations; Republicanism and Civic Virtue. | Inspirational, combative. | "How are YOU serving today!" | Video. | Founding Fathers, Republic, We the People. |
| We are close to needing this. Career politicians need to get the message that the American people are sick and tired of being ripped off and taken advantage of and then these same politicians expect a hand out. | 162345 | Relatable frustration. | Short rant to accusation. | Anti-establishment likes. | Limited Government; Republicanism. | Frustrated, populist. | Support term limits. | None. | American people. |
| ATTENTION! SUBJ: We either live in a Constitutional Republic or not! ACCOUNTABILITY, a cornerstone of a free and fair society, ensures that power is exercised responsibly by individuals, corporations, or government officials. It is closely linked to transparency, as it fosters trust and reinforces the principle that no one is above the law. When violations of public trust are dismissed as simple errors and transparency is resisted at every turn, it raises a fundamental question: Is the rule of law only meant for some and not others? @realDonaldTrump @AGPamBondi @DNIGabbard | 149460 | "ATTENTION!" military alert. | Memo format: subject + definition + question; tags. | Hypocrisy questions. | Justice; Limited Government. | Formal, demanding. | Demand accountability. | Video. | Constitutional Republic, rule of law. |
| Tim Dillon nails it. Most Americans are so sick of being lectured on why we have to care about every other foreign country in the world when we have so many serious problems of our own. | 449382 | Endorsement and complaint. | Short intro + quote. | Isolationism frustration shares. | National Sovereignty. | Casual, blunt. | None. | Video. | Americans. |
| They did it. On this day in 1787, the delegates to the federal convention in Philadelphia signed what would become the US Constitution. The odds had been stacked against them — but they refused to fail. They compromised. They innovated. They led. And they produced the best written constitution in human history. When he was leaving the convention after signing the Constitution, Benjamin Franklin was asked whether the convention had produced a republic or a monarchy. Franklin famously answered, “A republic, if you can keep it.” Having studied the failures of republics throughout history, the framers knew that a written constitution was a necessary foundation for republican government, but that every generation henceforth would be called upon to exercise the duties of being a citizen in a republic and to be good stewards of the Constitution. This meant that each generation would need to defend liberty and preserve the nation’s founding principles. Today, we celebrate the momentous achievement of the creation of the US Constitution but also remind ourselves that the future vitality of the republic lies in our hands. Our efforts to restore the founders’ vision for America are essential to ensure the endurance of a free society for generations to come. Happy Constitution Day! | 209155 | Triumphant "They did it" anecdote. | Story: event + quote + reflection; detailed flow. | Historical pride quotes. | Limited Government; Republicanism. | Celebratory, reflective. | Defend liberty. | None. | Framers, Franklin, Constitution. |
| .@POTUS @realDonaldTrump is 💯 right! Americans were lied to, silenced, and mocked for questioning the 2020 election. You don’t rig an election and then sermonize about “unity.” President Trump is right. Justice does not negotiate. A constitutional republic lives or dies by election integrity and accountability for the stolen 2020 election is non-negotiable. @DNIGabbard @AGPamBondi @SusieWiles @JDVance | 129013 | Endorsement with emoji. | Accusation + principle + tags. | Election controversy replies. | Justice, Law. | Defiant, supportive. | Demand accountability. | Video. | Constitutional republic. |
| A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, SHALL NOT BE INFRINGED. | 407132 | Caps emphasis quote. | Full Second Amendment; declarative. | 2A supporter likes. | Individual Liberties. | Bold, unyielding. | Protect the right. | None. | Second Amendment. |
| Accountability is not a burden — it is our responsibility as free citizens. When those in power betray the will of the people, they don't just fail one leader, they violate the Constitution itself. Real change has never come from the powerful but from courageous citizens who refuse to look away. If we want a Republic worth passing on, we must demand truth, insist on justice, and hold every leader to the standard our Founders built this Nation on. | 168286 | Duty reframing. | Definition + history + demand. | Citizen action shares. | Justice; Republicanism. | Empowering, historical. | Demand truth/justice. | Video. | Constitution, Founders, Republic. |
| The Founding Fathers: “Our Constitution was made only for a moral and religious people.” “To ourselves and our Posterity.” “Providence has been pleased to give this one connected country to one united people.” Conservative Inc: “Wow. America is truly an idea.” | 91122 | Quote juxtaposition irony. | Contrast; satirical. | Mocks establishment. | Moral Foundations; Sovereignty. | Sarcastic, critical. | None. | None. | Founding Fathers, Constitution. |
