          <p class="drop-cap">
            Fellow patriots, what insanity unfolds as elites in sanctuary havens
            like Minnesota shield invaders who drain our resources and spill
            innocent blood? In the last week, ICE warriors face ambushes and
            lawsuits for daring to enforce borders, while crossings plummet
            under bold leadership—proof that America First policies crush the
            chaos Biden unleashed.
          </p>

          <p>
            Yet Democrats wail "tyranny" as illegals commit murders shielded by
            their policies, eroding national sovereignty and mocking God-given
            unalienable rights. Inflation gnaws at the working man's pocket,
            with prices soaring from theft and taxes, a silent tax on
            self-reliance.
          </p>
          <p>
            And censorship creeps, with probes into truth-tellers and shutdowns
            silencing dissent, echoing globalist chains that bind free speech.
            As Proverbs 21:1 declares, the king's heart turns by the Lord's
            hand—pray He guides our leaders to expose these lies.
          </p>
          <p>
            This madness awakens the complacent: secure borders now, reject
            economic traps, defend liberty's voice. Dive into The Plain Truth
            for the roast on sanctuary subversion, and rally in Christ against
            oppression.

          <h3>The Plain Truth</h3>

          />
          <p class="drop-cap">
            Ah, the irony drips thicker than molasses in a Minnesota winter:
            Democrats sue the feds over ICE raids, screaming "Nazi tactics"
            while their sanctuary policies let killers roam free, slaughtering
            teens and draining billions in fraud. Picture this absurdity—a
            Venezuelan national ambushes an ICE agent with a shovel, causing
            internal bleeding, yet the mayor barks "get the f--- out" like a
            rabid dog guarding its bone.
          </p>

          <p>
            Logical breakdown: Sanctuary cities claim compassion, but shield
            rapists and murderers, turning streets into cartel playgrounds.
            Evidence? ICE detainers ignored, leading to preventable deaths in
            North Carolina and beyond—Breitbart tallies the toll, Fox exposes
            the scandals.
          </p>
          <p>
            This hypocrisy subverts rule of law under original
            constitutionalism, prioritizing globalist agendas over American
            lives. Exaggerate the madness: Elites lecture diversity while
            communities flood with unchecked migration, eroding sovereignty like
            acid on steel.
          </p>
          <p>
            Woke censors pile on, subpoenaing journalists for exposing truths,
            as if free speech is a crime. Tie it to national sovereignty over
            globalism: These traps mock unalienable rights, handing power to
            unelected tyrants.
          </p>
          <p>
            No apologies—dismantle this farce with satire's blade. The wicked
            rage, but truth exposes: Reclaim moral ground, enforce borders
            ruthlessly, reject the socialist snare. Point to Christ: In His
            light, hypocrisy crumbles—act now, faithful, before judgment falls.

            In these days of plummeting border crossings yet persistent
            sanctuary defiance, we witness patterns of chaos born from
            abandoning divine order, much as ancient Israel strayed into
            idolatry, inviting judgment. Consider Jeremiah 6:16: "Thus saith the
            Lord, Stand ye in the ways, and see, and ask for the old paths..."
          </p>
          <p>
            Exegesis reveals a call to realign with eternal foundations—biblical
            morality as the bedrock of nations, where limited government and
            self-reliance stem from fearing the Living God.
          </p>
          <p>
            Modern woes mirror this: Minnesota's mobs protesting ICE echo the
            rebellious crowds rejecting prophets, their hearts deceitful,
            fostering cultural decay through unchecked migration that erodes
            family structures and national sovereignty.
          </p>
          <p>
            Psychological insight: Such disorder arises from collective denial,
            where elites prioritize globalism over America's destiny, leading to
            inflation's theft of labor's fruit—a subtle idolatry of mammon.
          </p>
          <p>
            Scripture warns in Jeremiah of cities laid waste for forsaking
            truth; today, crimes by shielded illegals and censorship's veil
            (e.g., journalist subpoenas) signal impending collapse unless
            repentance turns the tide.
          </p>
          <p>
            Layered reasoning: Chaos thrives in moral vacuum, but order returns
            through discipline—revive traditional values, enforce rule of law.
            Anchor in faith: The Living God grants wisdom's start; realign
            families and nation to His paths, averting judgment. End with nudge:
            Repent of complacency, embrace Christ for revival.
          </p>

            Break down the wins: First, border apprehensions crater 85%
            post-inauguration, data from CBP proving Trump policies iterate
            effectively—testable components like ending catch-and-release yield
            measurable security, aligning with free enterprise by slashing fraud
            costs.
          </p>
          <p>
            Pragmatic iteration: GOP senators tout this at the border,
            rebranding tax cuts for working families, injecting efficiency into
            a bloated system. Second, inflation dips to 4.3%, logic shows energy
            dominance and supply chain hacks curbing price spikes from
            theft—visionary: Localize production to reject foreign dependency,
            boosting industrial strength.
          </p>
          <p>
            Third, pushback on censorship: Press groups blast House subpoena of
            journalist, defending unalienable rights; UK's fine on X sparks
            outrage, but Musk's defiance iterates free speech innovations.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fourth, economic banner year forecast by Rep. Tenney—data-driven:
            Growth surges as deficits tame, embodying personal responsibility.
            Fifth, sanctuary cracks: ICE raids expose fraud rings topping $2B in
            Minnesota, equipping communities to reclaim resources.
          </p>
          <p>
            These triumphs evidence God's sovereignty through bold
            experimentation—reject complacency, build sovereign strength like
            the ant. Nudge: Experiment with faith-based action in Christ for
            enduring progress.

            Reader Question: "With inflation biting hard and border chaos

          />
          <p class="drop-cap">
            Brother, draw from history's lessons: As Jefferson warned, elites
            sell out the heartland, shrinking paychecks while invaders burden
            schools and entitlements—echoing colonial exploitation that sparked
            revolution. Reflective strategy: Prioritize family as morality's
            bedrock, fostering self-reliance for independence.
          </p>
          <p>
            Step one: Budget wisely—track expenses, cut non-essentials, echoing
            Vance's hillbilly thrift amid rust belt decay. Step two: Build
            skills—train in trades like plumbing or coding, local governance
            programs offer free courses, resisting urban decadence.
          </p>
          <p>
            Step three: Secure home—join neighborhood watches, advocate for
            local enforcement against sanctuary follies, upholding original
            constitutionalism.
          </p>
          <p>
            Step four: Educate kin—teach biblical values via Proverbs 22:6,
            countering woke indoctrination with home discussions on America
            First.
          </p>
          <p>
            Step five: Stock essentials—modest pantry against inflation spikes,
            drawing from frontier self-sufficiency. This protects dignity,
            strengthens communities—no nonsense, empathetic plain-speak. Tie to
            personal responsibility: Answer to God, provide for yours. Action in
            faith: Train up in Christ's way for enduring strength.
