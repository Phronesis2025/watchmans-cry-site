            Patriots, behold the hour! As 2026 unfolds, the republic quakes
            under the weight of lawlessness unleashed. Tens of thousands flood
            Minneapolis streets in raging protests over the fatal ICE shooting
            of activist Renee Good—chanting "Abolish ICE," hurling ice and
            rocks, blocking roads in defiance of order. Nationwide, over 1,000
            rallies erupt against deportations, from Portland to Columbus, with
            violence flaring: protesters clashing with officers, vehicles
            ramming threats, death threats skyrocketing. DHS reports assaults on
            ICE agents up 1,300%, vehicular attacks 3,200%, death threats
            8,000%—a direct fruit of radical rhetoric from sanctuary politicians
            and cultural scorn for God's appointed sword-bearers.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is no mere unrest; it's rebellion against divine order. "He
            beareth not the sword in vain" (Romans 13:4). The wicked mock
            authority, glorify chaos, and invite judgment, while the complacent
            slumber. Yet hope stirs: citizen truth-tellers rise on new
            frontiers, dismantling legacy media's lies; grit of the founders
            endures at our 250th milestone. We anger the wicked by naming their
            rebellion, awaken the sleeping with prophetic thunder, equip the
            faithful with self-reliance, and point to Christ—the Prince of Peace
            who submits yet triumphs over lawlessness.
          </p>
          <p>
            Strip to roots: limited government, rule of law, biblical
            morality—all under assault. Borders mocked, heritage eroded,
            families threatened by imported disorder. But God stirs revival amid
            shadows. Rise, watchmen! The cry goes forth: restore order, reclaim
            sovereignty, or face the furnace of consequences. Common sense
            reborn demands vigilance now.
          </p>

            Brother, sister—pull up a chair. It's 2026, and this nation of ours
            is turning 250 years old. Think on that. In 1776, ordinary
            folks—blacksmiths, farmers, millers, men and women with dirt under
            their nails—stood up and said enough to tyranny. They risked
            everything on a simple truth: that liberty comes from God, not
            governments, and that the common man, through hard work and
            perseverance, can govern himself.
          </p>

          <p>
            We've proven it time and again. From scratching out homesteads on
            raw frontier to forging steel that won wars and built skyscrapers
            that scrape the heavens. We fed the world from our fields, lit the
            dark with our inventions, and sent rockets to the moon on the sweat
            of shift workers and engineers who clocked in every dawn. It wasn't
            handouts or shortcuts—it was callused hands, long hours, and the
            stubborn refusal to quit. That's the American character:
            perseverance when the crop fails, the factory closes, or the bills
            stack high. We answer to our families, our communities, and our God,
            not to distant bureaucrats.
          </p>

          <p>
            Sure, we've got our divisions—red states, blue states, loud
            arguments across kitchen tables. But strip it all away, and you'll
            find the same abundance underneath: that rock-solid work ethic
            running through every American vein. The welder in Ohio and the
            rancher in Texas, the nurse in California and the trucker in
            Pennsylvania—they all know sunrise means roll out of bed, provide
            for your own, and leave the place better for your kids. That's not
            politics; that's who we are.
          </p>

          <p>
            And that's why my heart stirs with real hope as we hit this
            milestone. Caution, yes—we've got debts to pay down, borders to
            secure, and moral drift to correct. But the possibilities? Endless,
            if we lean on what got us here. Hard work and perseverance built
            this republic, and they'll rebuild it stronger. Imagine our children
            inheriting factories humming again, communities tight-knit and
            self-reliant, opportunities flowing from honest labor—not government
            schemes, but American grit turned loose.
          </p>

          <p>
            So here's the quiet rally cry, from one working man to another: Roll
            up your sleeves once more. Teach your boys and girls that nothing
            worthwhile comes easy, but anything is possible with faith and
            sweat. Build that business, fix that neighborhood, stand for what's
            right. For their sake—for the grandkids who'll run these fields and
            factories—let's pass on an America even greater than the one handed
            to us.
          </p>

          <p>
            Point to Christ, who worked with His hands and never quit the
            mission. Common sense reborn: our best days aren't behind us.
            They're waiting on the other side of tomorrow's hard work. Let's go
            get 'em.

            My heart is heavy, brethren, as I survey this fractured land in
            January 2026. I weep for the unfaithfulness that has brought us
            low—the hatred that claimed young Charlie Kirk's life in September
            2025, struck down at Utah Valley University by a hand poisoned with
            ideological venom. He stood as a watchman for truth among the youth,
            unyielding in the cultural fray, and his blood cries out like
            Abel's. Yet even in this grief, I see the Sovereign hand stirring:
            persecution scatters seed, and revival's quiet fire spreads.
          </p>

          <p>
            Look—Passion 2026 gathered over 45,000 young souls in worship, a
            thunderous roar of praise echoing heaven. Commitment to Christ among
            Gen Z men has surged 15 points since 2019; baptisms rise on
            campuses, lingering prayers recall Asbury's outpouring. Weary of
            chaos and empty promises, the young seek order in eternal truth.
            Will you not see it? This is no fleeting emotion but a hunger for
            meaning—for lives built on discipline, voluntary suffering, and bold
            stand against the dragon of disorder.
          </p>

          <p>
            Yet peril looms, as foretold: "In the last days perilous times will
            come" (2 Timothy 3:1)—men lovers of self, haters of good,
            persecutors of the faithful. Antisemitism festers, occult lures
            multiply, moral foundations crumble like Jerusalem's walls in my
            day. I warned Israel then of judgment for idolatry and rebellion:
            exile, sword, famine if they scorned the Lord. So now—nations that
            mock truth invite ruin. The spirit behind Kirk's murder stirs
            division; reject it, or reap desolation. My soul anguishes over the
            rejection I endure, echoing ancient scorn, but truth must be spoken:
            without repentance, darkness deepens.
          </p>

          <p>
            Stand up, then! Speak truth though it costs you—shoulder your cross
            daily, order your life with fierce discipline. Chaos devours the
            aimless; only the resolute find purpose worth living. Confront the
            lie, bear responsibility, build your house on rock—a worthwhile
            existence forged in fire.
          </p>

          <p>
            But hope endures, for the Lord promises restoration: "If My
            people... humble themselves and pray... I will heal their land" (2
            Chronicles 7:14). And behold the new covenant: "I will put My law in
            their minds, and write it on their hearts; and I will be their God"
            (Jeremiah 31:33). Despite tears and rejection, He renews—prodigals
            return, families strengthen, nations breathe anew.
          </p>
          <p>
            Point to Christ, slain yet risen, who turns martyrdom to
            multiplication. The Almighty weeps with us, yet calls: repent, stand
            firm, live truly. Revival burns—fan the flame.

          <p class="drop-cap">
            Amid the storm of lawlessness and protest, victory dawns on the
            information battlefield! Legacy media—CNN, MSNBC, The New York
            Times—once monopolized "truth," but in 2026, their empire cracks
            under the weight of exposed lies. Trust polls hit rock bottom;
            ratings crater as Americans reject propaganda mills that buried
            scandals, pivoted on COVID origins without apology, and downplayed
            fraud while amplifying edited clips to demonize ICE and border
            enforcement.
          </p>

          <p>
            But behold the triumph: citizen journalists on X, Rumble, and
            Substack iterate faster, verify harder, reach millions unfiltered.
            Lone posters geolocate empty "daycares" in fraud rings, viral
            threads dismantle narratives with receipts, millions fact-check in
            real time. Elon Musk's open-source platform demolishes walls—garage
            sleuths, trucker podcasters, heartland investigators lead the
            charge. This is free enterprise reborn: self-reliant patriots
            building parallel systems, innovating around censorship like
            pioneers routing blockades.
          </p>

          <p>
            Wins abound: Media Bias Tracker catalogs lies weekly; boycotts
            starve the beast; open platforms empower truth over agenda. The
            guilty scorched—retracted stories pile high, coordination leaks
            expose coordination. Parallel media ecosystem tips toward dominance:
            one major exposure, and the old guard collapses.
          </p>

          <p>
            Rejoice! "The truth shall make you free" (John 8:32). Citizen
            truth-tellers rise—equipping the faithful, angering the wicked,
            pointing to Christ who is Truth incarnate. The new frontier belongs
            to the vigilant; liberty flourishes where facts win.

            Yet spare me the lamentations. Whining profits less than a

          />

          <p class="drop-cap">
            My good friend, in this busy age of 2026, many a man sets his sights
            on grand ventures—shedding the spare tire, launching a trade on the
            side, or clearing debts that weigh like lead—only to find them
            vanished come spring. 'Tis a common folly, but one easily mended
            with plain ingenuity and a dash of stubborn grit. The secret to
            goals you truly pursue? Craft them not as lofty castles in the air,
            but as sturdy machines: built piece by piece, tested in the field,
            and tweaked till they roar.
          </p>

          <p>
            First, anchor thy aim in solid ground. Ask thyself: Why this
            pursuit? Doth it fortify thy family, honor thy Maker's call to
            stewardship, or secure thy independence against fickle winds? A goal
            without a firm "why" is like a rocket without fuel—spectacular
            launch, inevitable crash. (And trust me, I've seen enough explosions
            to know: better to iterate on the pad than mid-flight.)
          </p>
          <p>
            Next, divide the labor into short campaigns—no vague vows of "more
            exercise," but pledges like "three brisk walks a week, marking
            progress in a simple ledger." Run it for a month, measure the yield,
            then refine. Miss the mark? Diagnose the fault calmly—too ambitious?
            Life's interruptions?—and adjust the design. As old Ben might say,
            "He that can have patience can have what he will," but with a modern
            twist: patience plus rapid prototyping beats blind perseverance
            every time.
          </p>
          <p>
            Build checks against sloth: Share thy ledger with a trusted
            companion or kin—nothing spurs a man like a friendly wager or
            watchful eye. Reward steady progress plainly—a hearty meal earned,
            not promised in vain.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then, link new habits to old reliables. Crave sharper wits through
            reading? Tie twenty pages to thy morning brew. 'Tis the compound
            interest of discipline: small daily investments grow mighty, without
            upheaval.
          </p>
          <p>
            Setbacks? Laugh at them—they're mere data points. One failed sprint?
            "Well, that didn't work—back to the drawing board." Humor in the
            grind keeps the fire lit; after all, if building rockets to Mars
            taught anything, it's that most explode on the way, but the ones
            that land change everything.

            Fellow traveler, this method turns wishes into works. In times of
            uncertainty, such self-mastery is thy greatest tool—providing bolder
            for thine own, leading with quiet strength. Begin modestly today:
            Choose one aim, sketch its parts, launch the trial. Persevere with
            wit and wisdom, and watch thy fortunes multiply.
          </p>

          <h3>Prayer of the Week & Closing Call</h3>

          <p class="drop-cap">
            <strong>Prayer:</strong> Almighty Architect of order and liberty,
            who designed nations with purpose and equipped men to defend the
            good—shield our law enforcement, those frontline builders of civil
            peace, from the chaos of ambush and scorn. Expose the flaws in
            rebellious systems, reinforce the weak points in our society, and
            iterate obedience into the hearts of Your people. Grant leaders
            clear blueprints for justice, families the raw materials of
            resilience, and truth-tellers the tools to prototype a better
            tomorrow. Through disciplined repentance, debug this land's errors
            and recompile it strong. Point us ever to Christ, the Master
            Engineer who turns entropy into eternal design. In His name, Amen.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Call to Action:</strong> Builders, launch this edition far
            and wide—share it like open-source code. Prototype resilience at
            home: secure your foundations, pray daily for the guardians on the
            line, network with neighbors into unbreakable communities, and vote
            for policies that deregulate freedom and onshore strength.
            Experiment boldly, iterate without fear—America's next upgrade
            depends on innovators like you. The clock ticks, but the blueprint
            for victory is already drawn in Christ. Get building.
