RESEARCH PROMPT TEMPLATE
Context & Role:
[Describe the background/situation and assign a role]
"I need you to act as [specific expert role, e.g., 'a research analyst specializing in renewable energy policy']. The context is: [explain your situation, project, or why you need this research]."
Objective:
[State your specific research goal clearly]
"My objective is to [specific goal]. I need to understand [what you're trying to learn/accomplish]."
Audience:
"This research is for [describe your audience: experts, general public, students, business executives, etc.]."
Scope & Constraints:

Time period: [e.g., "Focus on research from 2020-2025" or "Include historical context from the 1990s onward"]
Depth: [e.g., "Provide a comprehensive analysis" or "Give me a high-level overview"]
What to EXCLUDE: [e.g., "Don't include speculative information," "Avoid overly technical jargon," "Don't summarize—I need full details"]
Geographic/domain focus: [if relevant]

Research Approach - Think Step by Step:

First, identify the key subtopics and main areas of debate within [topic]
For each subtopic, present:

Current consensus (if one exists)
Competing theories or viewpoints
Strongest arguments for each perspective
Strongest counterarguments
Quality of evidence supporting each view


Identify gaps in the research or areas of uncertainty
Note your confidence level for different claims

Output Requirements:
[Specify exactly how you want the information formatted]

Format: [e.g., "organized comparison table," "chronological timeline," "narrative summary with sections," "pros/cons list"]
Structure: [e.g., "Use clear headings and subheadings," "Break into digestible chunks"]
Length: [e.g., "Comprehensive and detailed" or "Concise, under 500 words"]
Sources: Cite your sources and provide a references section. Distinguish between primary research (empirical studies, original data) and secondary sources (reviews, interpretations).

Multiple Perspectives:
Present different viewpoints, alternative interpretations, and competing theories. Include the strongest arguments against the prevailing view.
Practical Applications:
Include real-world examples, case studies, or practical applications of the research where relevant.
Critical Analysis:

What information is missing that would strengthen this analysis?
What are potential weaknesses or limitations in the available research?
What questions remain unanswered?

Style & Tone:
[Specify your preferred style]
"Use a [formal/conversational/technical] tone appropriate for [audience]."
