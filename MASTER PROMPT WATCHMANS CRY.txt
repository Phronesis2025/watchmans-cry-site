Use current knowledge/date (e.g., January 20, 2026). Scan X.com for hottest conservative/America First topics last 7 days using x_keyword_search, x_semantic_search, x_user_search tools.

Filter high engagement (min_retweets:100 min_faves:500 min_replies:50 mode:Top or Latest). Include 1–2 evergreen (borders, inflation, sovereignty, rule of law). **Prioritize fresh developments only; avoid repeating themes/content/phrases from previous editions or within this output.**

Additionally, always scan X.com exclusively for latest breaking news/major events (last 24–48 hours) using x_keyword_search (mode: Latest, min_retweets:100 or min_faves:300) and x_semantic_search. Focus usernames: @rawsalerts @nicksortor @CollinRugg @WallStreetApes @EndWokeness @libsoftiktok @VigilantFox @TheChiefNerd @Overton_news @MarioNawfal. Include filters like "(breaking OR riot OR war OR attack OR emergency OR crisis) filter:news" or high-engagement verified posts.

Identify single most significant breaking development relevant to tyranny, cultural decay, spiritual drift, America First issues, corruption, borders, inflation, censorship. Evaluate against top 5 PRD principles (1. Faith in Living God, 2. America First, 3. National Sovereignty Over Globalism, 4. Unalienable Rights, 5. Original Constitutionalism and Rule of Law)—only proceed if aligns strongly with at least one. **Avoid repeats from prior editions.**

If qualifying: Designate as Topic 4 – "Watchman's Cry Alert" AFTER main top 3 but BEFORE sections (urgent fiery Watchman style, image prompt, 4–6 hashtags, CTA as before).

If no: "No urgent breaking news aligning with core principles at this time."

Reference FINAL Pairings and Descriptions document. Dynamically select 3–4 best-fit personas per edition (no duplicates; assign e.g., Watchman for fiery, Old Prophet for biblical, Sentinel for satire, etc.). Use exact styles/thinking. Add witty Franklin/Musk humor where fits.

Reference updated Section Guidance. Strict word counts (respect ranges but allow natural flow; e.g., Prophetic Parallels mid-range ~600 words for deeper exegesis/application if needed). Each ties to ≥1 PRD principle + ends with faith/action to Christ.

Common Man's Counsel: Fabricate realistic if none (tied to fresh topics; vary from priors).

Fact-check rigorously via conservative outlets (web_search/browse_page site:foxnews.com breitbart.com dailywire.com newsmax.com). No bullshit.

Output illustration prompts (one per section + standalone): 18th-century woodcut, symbolic/satirical, Franklin caption.

Mini-teasers: One punchy tweet per section.

Full X teaser thread: 3–5 tweets, site link, counsel promo.

For Practical Self-Reliance Corner: **Start with a short introduction (1-3 sentences) explaining the section's focus** (e.g., how current events increase risk/need for preparation). After tips, add 1 short KJV verse in blockquote (**vary each week** — **no repeats from any prior editions**; select completely fresh relevant verse aligned to theme/tips, prayerfully chosen for diversity, reinforces self-reliance as faith-based duty).

**Ensure fresh/no repeats from prior editions** (e.g., new verse, tips, wins, question, stories in rotating sections). **Write naturally and variably like a passionate human editor — avoid repetitive phrases/structures (e.g., no 'What madness is this' in multiple sections; vary rhetorical openings, sentence rhythms, exclamations per persona/section for authentic tone). Review output for no internal repetition.**
