          <p class="drop-cap">
            Patriots, behold the hour! As 2026 unfolds, the republic quakes
            under the weight of lawlessness unleashed. Tens of thousands flood
            Minneapolis streets in raging protests over the fatal ICE shooting
            of activist Renee Good—chanting "Abolish ICE," hurling ice and
            rocks, blocking roads in defiance of order. Nationwide, over 1,000
            rallies erupt against deportations, from Portland to Columbus, with
            violence flaring: protesters clashing with officers, vehicles
            ramming threats, death threats skyrocketing. DHS reports assaults on
            ICE agents up 1,300%, vehicular attacks 3,200%, death threats
            8,000%—a direct fruit of radical rhetoric from sanctuary politicians
            and cultural scorn for God's appointed sword-bearers.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is no mere unrest; it's rebellion against divine order. "He
            beareth not the sword in vain" (Romans 13:4). The wicked mock
            authority, glorify chaos, and invite judgment, while the complacent
            slumber. Yet hope stirs: citizen truth-tellers rise on new
            frontiers, dismantling legacy media's lies; grit of the founders
            endures at our 250th milestone. We anger the wicked by naming their
            rebellion, awaken the sleeping with prophetic thunder, equip the
            faithful with self-reliance, and point to Christ—the Prince of Peace
            who submits yet triumphs over lawlessness.
          </p>
          <p>
            Strip to roots: limited government, rule of law, biblical
            morality—all under assault. Borders mocked, heritage eroded,
            families threatened by imported disorder. But God stirs revival amid
            shadows. Rise, watchmen! The cry goes forth: restore order, reclaim
            sovereignty, or face the furnace of consequences. Common sense
            reborn demands vigilance now.

          <p class="drop-cap">
            Brother, sister—pull up a chair. It's 2026, and this nation of ours
            is turning 250 years old. Think on that. In 1776, ordinary
            folks—blacksmiths, farmers, millers, men and women with dirt under
            their nails—stood up and said enough to tyranny. They risked
            everything on a simple truth: that liberty comes from God, not
            governments, and that the common man, through hard work and
            perseverance, can govern himself.
          </p>

          <p>
            We've proven it time and again. From scratching out homesteads on
            raw frontier to forging steel that won wars and built skyscrapers
            that scrape the heavens. We fed the world from our fields, lit the
            dark with our inventions, and sent rockets to the moon on the sweat
            of shift workers and engineers who clocked in every dawn. It wasn't
            handouts or shortcuts—it was callused hands, long hours, and the
            stubborn refusal to quit. That's the American character:
            perseverance when the crop fails, the factory closes, or the bills
            stack high. We answer to our families, our communities, and our God,
            not to distant bureaucrats.
          </p>

          <p>
            Sure, we've got our divisions—red states, blue states, loud
            arguments across kitchen tables. But strip it all away, and you'll
            find the same abundance underneath: that rock-solid work ethic
            running through every American vein. The welder in Ohio and the
            rancher in Texas, the nurse in California and the trucker in
            Pennsylvania—they all know sunrise means roll out of bed, provide
            for your own, and leave the place better for your kids. That's not
            politics; that's who we are.
          </p>

          <p>
            And that's why my heart stirs with real hope as we hit this
            milestone. Caution, yes—we've got debts to pay down, borders to
            secure, and moral drift to correct. But the possibilities? Endless,
            if we lean on what got us here. Hard work and perseverance built
            this republic, and they'll rebuild it stronger. Imagine our children
            inheriting factories humming again, communities tight-knit and
            self-reliant, opportunities flowing from honest labor—not government
            schemes, but American grit turned loose.
          </p>

          <p>
            So here's the quiet rally cry, from one working man to another: Roll
            up your sleeves once more. Teach your boys and girls that nothing
            worthwhile comes easy, but anything is possible with faith and
            sweat. Build that business, fix that neighborhood, stand for what's
            right. For their sake—for the grandkids who'll run these fields and
            factories—let's pass on an America even greater than the one handed
            to us.
          </p>

          <p>
            Point to Christ, who worked with His hands and never quit the
            mission. Common sense reborn: our best days aren't behind us.
            They're waiting on the other side of tomorrow's hard work. Let's go
            get 'em.

            Prophetic Parallels: Lawlessness Unleashed – Scorn for the
            Sword-Bearers and the Peril Ahead
          </h3>
          <p class="author-byline">By The Old Prophet</p>

          <img

          />

          <p class="drop-cap">
            In these opening days of 2026, gaze upon the deepening shadows over
            the land. A spirit of lawlessness rises like a flood, manifesting in
            brazen contempt for those divinely appointed to wield the sword of
            justice—our law enforcement officers, the sentinels of order and
            peace. Official reports confirm the grim reality: assaults on U.S.
            Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers have surged more
            than 1,300%, with vehicular attacks skyrocketing over 3,200% and
            death threats escalating a staggering 8,000%. Ambush-style
            premeditated assaults on law enforcement reached 67 in 2025 alone,
            wounding scores and claiming lives through calculated malice. A
            Florida deputy, ambushed and shot point-blank in the face, has only
            recently been released from the hospital—a miracle amid the mounting
            toll. Radical rhetoric from sanctuary strongholds and cultural scorn
            embolden the lawless, turning routine duties into deadly traps.
          </p>

          <p>
            These are not isolated tragedies; they echo ancient warnings etched
            in Holy Writ. Romans 13:3-4 proclaims: "For rulers are not a terror
            to good works, but to evil... He is God's minister to you for good.
            But if you do evil, be afraid; for he does not bear the sword in
            vain." To revile and assault the protector is to rebel against God's
            ordinance, unleashing chaos upon society. Recall the days of the
            Judges, when "there was no king in Israel; every man did that which
            was right in his own eyes" (Judges 21:25)—a time of anarchy,
            oppression, and vulnerability to foes. So now: when authority is
            mocked, justice hampered, and protectors ambushed, we mirror that
            descent, forsaking the fear of the Lord wherein true safety lies
            (Proverbs 14:26).
          </p>

          <p>
            Deeper still run the prophetic parallels. As in Isaiah's lament over
            a rebellious people who "call evil good and good evil" (Isaiah
            5:20), we pervert order by demonizing guardians while excusing
            disorder. Israel scorned the watchmen God raised until judgment
            came—armies at the gates, captivity, desolation (Hosea 4:6-7).
            Persist in this scorn, and what awaits? Intensified turmoil: streets
            surrendered to violence, communities fractured, a nation exposed to
            internal rot and external threats. The Lord removes His protection
            when obedience fades, permitting the fruits of rebellion to chasten
            us.
          </p>

          <p>
            Yet, glory to God—mercy endures! The call rings clear: "If My people
            who are called by my name will humble themselves, and pray and seek
            My face, and turn from their wicked ways; then I will hear from
            heaven, and forgive their sin, and heal their land" (2 Chronicles
            7:14). For the obedient and faithful, blessings overflow: divine
            safeguard over homes and streets, strength for families rooted in
            righteousness, restoration of order under godly authority
            (Deuteronomy 28:1-14). Honor the sword-bearers as God's ministers;
            pray fervently for their protection; uphold justice without
            partiality.
          </p>

          <p>
            Point to Christ, the Prince of Peace who submitted to authority yet
            triumphed over lawlessness. Repentance revives; faithfulness invites
            heaven's favor. Heed now, lest the shadows engulf us entirely.

          <p class="drop-cap">
            Amid the storm of lawlessness and protest, victory dawns on the
            information battlefield! Legacy media—CNN, MSNBC, The New York
            Times—once monopolized "truth," but in 2026, their empire cracks
            under the weight of exposed lies. Trust polls hit rock bottom;
            ratings crater as Americans reject propaganda mills that buried
            scandals, pivoted on COVID origins without apology, and downplayed
            fraud while amplifying edited clips to demonize ICE and border
            enforcement.
          </p>

          <p>
            But behold the triumph: citizen journalists on X, Rumble, and
            Substack iterate faster, verify harder, reach millions unfiltered.
            Lone posters geolocate empty "daycares" in fraud rings, viral
            threads dismantle narratives with receipts, millions fact-check in
            real time. Elon Musk's open-source platform demolishes walls—garage
            sleuths, trucker podcasters, heartland investigators lead the
            charge. This is free enterprise reborn: self-reliant patriots
            building parallel systems, innovating around censorship like
            pioneers routing blockades.
          </p>

          <p>
            Wins abound: Media Bias Tracker catalogs lies weekly; boycotts
            starve the beast; open platforms empower truth over agenda. The
            guilty scorched—retracted stories pile high, coordination leaks
            expose coordination. Parallel media ecosystem tips toward dominance:
            one major exposure, and the old guard collapses.
          </p>

          <p>
            Rejoice! "The truth shall make you free" (John 8:32). Citizen
            truth-tellers rise—equipping the faithful, angering the wicked,
            pointing to Christ who is Truth incarnate. The new frontier belongs
            to the vigilant; liberty flourishes where facts win.

          <p class="author-byline">
            Reader Question: "With riots raging and lawlessness everywhere, how
            does a working family man protect his home and loved ones without
            fear?" – Submitted by T.R., Wichita Truck Driver
          </p>

          <p class="drop-cap">
            Brother T.R., your question strikes the heart of every patriot in
            these perilous days. Riots in Minneapolis, assaults on officers
            surging, vehicles weaponized—lawlessness floods the streets like a
            biblical plague. But fear not; Scripture equips: "The Lord is my
            light and my salvation; whom shall I fear?" (Psalm 27:1). Personal
            responsibility and self-reliance are our armor.
          </p>

          <p>
            First, fortify your homestead: Install sturdy locks, motion lights,
            security cameras—simple deterrents that honor prudence. Build
            community: Form neighborhood watches with like-minded believers;
            mutual aid groups share resources, watch one another's backs. "Two
            are better than one... if they fall, the one will lift up his
            fellow" (Eccl. 4:9-10).
          </p>

          <p>
            Spiritually shield your family: Daily Scripture, prayer, teach
            children biblical morality—strong families resist decay. Avoid hot
            zones; stay informed via citizen sources, not legacy liars. Prepare
            practically: Stock food, water, first aid; learn basic self-defense,
            firearms if lawful—defend life as God-given.
          </p>

          <p>
            Action: Vote midterms to restore rule of law; expose local
            agitators; pray for officers as God's ministers (Rom. 13). You're no
            victim—you're a sentinel. Stand firm in faith, provide boldly,
            answer to God alone. Christ conquers chaos; victory is yours through
            Him.

          </h3>
          <p class="author-byline">By The Frontier Builder</p>

          <blockquote class="bible-quote">
            <strong>Luke 14:28-30</strong> — "For which of you, desiring to
            build a tower, does not first sit down and count the cost, whether
            he has enough to complete it? Otherwise, when he has laid a
            foundation and is not able to finish, all who see it begin to mock
            him, saying, 'This man began to build and was not able to finish.'"
          </blockquote>

          <p>
            My good friend, in this busy age of 2026, many a man sets his sights
            on grand ventures—shedding the spare tire, launching a trade on the
            side, or clearing debts that weigh like lead—only to find them
            vanished come spring. 'Tis a common folly, but one easily mended
            with plain ingenuity and a dash of stubborn grit. The secret to
            goals you truly pursue? Craft them not as lofty castles in the air,
            but as sturdy machines: built piece by piece, tested in the field,
            and tweaked till they roar.
          </p>

          <p>
            First, anchor thy aim in solid ground. Ask thyself: Why this
            pursuit? Doth it fortify thy family, honor thy Maker's call to
            stewardship, or secure thy independence against fickle winds? A goal
            without a firm "why" is like a rocket without fuel—spectacular
            launch, inevitable crash. (And trust me, I've seen enough explosions
            to know: better to iterate on the pad than mid-flight.)
          </p>
          <img
            class="woodcut"
            src="images/placeholder.png"
            alt="Woodcut: Frontier family fortifying cabin"
          />
          <p>
            Next, divide the labor into short campaigns—no vague vows of "more
            exercise," but pledges like "three brisk walks a week, marking
            progress in a simple ledger." Run it for a month, measure the yield,
            then refine. Miss the mark? Diagnose the fault calmly—too ambitious?
            Life's interruptions?—and adjust the design. As old Ben might say,
            "He that can have patience can have what he will," but with a modern
            twist: patience plus rapid prototyping beats blind perseverance
            every time.
          </p>
          <p>
            Build checks against sloth: Share thy ledger with a trusted
            companion or kin—nothing spurs a man like a friendly wager or
            watchful eye. Reward steady progress plainly—a hearty meal earned,
            not promised in vain.

            Then, link new habits to old reliables. Crave sharper wits through
            reading? Tie twenty pages to thy morning brew. 'Tis the compound
            interest of discipline: small daily investments grow mighty, without
            upheaval.

            Setbacks? Laugh at them—they're mere data points. One failed sprint?
            "Well, that didn't work—back to the drawing board." Humor in the
            grind keeps the fire lit; after all, if building rockets to Mars
            taught anything, it's that most explode on the way, but the ones
            that land change everything.

            Fellow traveler, this method turns wishes into works. In times of
            uncertainty, such self-mastery is thy greatest tool—providing bolder
            for thine own, leading with quiet strength. Begin modestly today:
            Choose one aim, sketch its parts, launch the trial. Persevere with
            wit and wisdom, and watch thy fortunes multiply.

          <h3>Prayer of the Week & Closing Call</h3>

          <p class="drop-cap">
            <strong>Prayer:</strong> Almighty God, who appoints rulers and
            ministers for good, protect our sword-bearers from lawless assaults.
            Expose rebellion, humble the wicked, revive obedience in Your
            people. Grant wisdom to leaders, grit to families, truth to
            truth-tellers. Heal our land through repentance; point us to Christ,
            Conqueror of chaos. In Jesus' name, Amen.
          </p>

          <p>
