          <h3>How We Use Your Information</h3>
          <p class="drop-cap">
            The information we collect is used solely for website analytics to:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Understand which content is most popular</li>
            <li>Improve website performance and user experience</li>

            We do not sell, rent, or share your information with third parties.

          <h3>Privacy Protections</h3>
          <p class="drop-cap">
            We implement several measures to protect your privacy:
          </p>

          <h4>IP Address Hashing</h4>
          <p>
            Your IP address is immediately hashed using SHA-256 encryption before
            storage. This means we cannot identify you or your specific location
            from the stored data. The hashed value is used only to distinguish
            unique visitors.
          </p>

          <h4>No Cookies</h4>
          <p>
            We do not use cookies. Session information is stored only in your
            browser's sessionStorage, which is automatically cleared when you
            close your browser.
          </p>

          <h4>Do Not Track</h4>
          <p>
            We respect your browser's "Do Not Track" setting. If you have Do Not
            Track enabled, we will not collect any analytics data from your
            visit.
          </p>

          <h4>Minimal Data Collection</h4>
          <p>
            We collect only what is necessary for basic website analytics. We do
            not collect personal information, browsing history from other sites,
            or any data that could be used to identify you.
          </p>
        </article>

        <article>
          <h3>Data Storage and Retention</h3>
          <p class="drop-cap">
            Analytics data is stored securely in our database. We retain this
            data for up to 24 months to allow for year-over-year comparisons
            and trend analysis. After this period, data is automatically
            deleted.
          </p>
          <p>
            All data is stored on secure servers with appropriate access
            controls. Only authorized administrators can access analytics data,
            and only for the purposes described in this policy.

          <h3>Your Rights</h3>
          <p class="drop-cap">
            Depending on your location, you may have certain rights regarding
            your data:
          </p>

          <h4>Right to Access</h4>
          <p>
            You have the right to know what data we have collected about you.
            However, since we hash IP addresses and do not collect personal
            information, we cannot identify specific data tied to you as an
            individual.
          </p>

          <h4>Right to Deletion</h4>
          <p>
            You may request deletion of your data. However, because we hash IP
            addresses and do not store personal identifiers, we cannot identify
            specific records to delete. If you have concerns, please contact us
            using the information below.
          </p>

          <h4>Right to Opt-Out</h4>
          <p>
            You can opt-out of analytics tracking by enabling "Do Not Track" in
            your browser settings. We respect this setting and will not collect
            any data when it is enabled.
          </p>

          <h4>GDPR and CCPA Compliance</h4>
          <p>
            We comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the
            California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). Our data collection
            practices are designed to minimize privacy impact while still
            providing useful website analytics.

          </ul>
          <p>
            These services are used only for the technical operation of our
