            The Watchman serves as the primary voice of this publication, taking
            up the mantle of vigilance and truth-telling. Drawing from a
            background in history, philosophy, and public affairs, The Watchman
            provides the opening dispatches and oversees the editorial direction
            of the publication.
          </p>
          <p>
            The role of the watchman is ancient and sacred—to stand guard, to
            observe, to warn, and to guide. In this tradition, The Watchman
            seeks to fulfill the duty of speaking truth to power and providing
            clarity in times of confusion.

            The Chronicler is responsible for the Prophetic Parallels section,
            examining historical patterns and drawing lessons from the past.
            With expertise in historical research and analysis, The Chronicler
            helps readers understand how the challenges of today relate to those
            faced by previous generations.
          </p>
          <p>
            History, as The Chronicler reminds us, does not repeat itself, but
            it often rhymes. By understanding these patterns, we can better
            navigate the complexities of our own time.

            The Counselor believes that wisdom is not the exclusive domain of
            the learned or the powerful, but is available to all who seek it
            with an open mind and a willing heart.
