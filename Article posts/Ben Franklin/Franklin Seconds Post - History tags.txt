Fellow builders—

Freedom begins with leverage.

Franklin didn't grind until death.

He retired at 42 to change the world.

How? He invented the franchise 200 years early.

2/6
Printing partnerships in every major colony.

He supplied press and capital.

Partner ran daily operations.

Profits split clean.

Passive income funded science, diplomacy, revolution.

Smart systems > endless toil.

3/6
He even printed colonial currency—literally making money to make money.

But grounded in virtue:

Industry to create.

Frugality to keep.

Proverbs 13:11 — Wealth gained honestly grows.

4/6
This financial sovereignty gave him freedom to serve.

Lesson: Break dependency.

Build what outlasts you.

Innovate wisely, iterate boldly, honor God in labor.

Your family’s future demands it.

5/6
Yet Franklin knew systems alone aren't enough.

He paired leverage with humility—acknowledging Providence when reason reached its edge.

Full liberty = virtue + vision.

What are you building this year?
